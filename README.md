## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The repository is for the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Course. This project was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.


## Included in the Repository

The Codebook.md which explains the variables, the data and any trasnformations when cleaning up the data. Along with the code called run_analysis.R which does the following steps.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
